# The Anxiety Time Machine

> See your current worries through the lens of the future.

**Built by Boyi Sun, Ruoyu Wu and Xiaoyue Yu for She Innovates 2026.**

## Inspiration
As college students, we often feel overwhelmed by anxiety—whether it relates to grades, relationships, or financial stability. In the moment, these problems feel insurmountable. However, we realized that these same issues might look completely different to someone who is 30, 60, or 90 years old.

We built **The Anxiety Time Machine** to bridge the gap between generations. Our goal is to provide perspective and relief to anxious minds by showing how priorities and viewpoints shift over a lifetime.

## What it does
The Anxiety Time Machine is a web-based interactive tool that helps users reframe their current struggles. Currently, the platform focuses on the "viewing" experience:

1.  **Input Phase:** The user enters their current age and selects a specific source of anxiety (e.g., Money, Love, Career).
2.  **Time Travel Interaction:** The user drags a time slider to "travel" to the future, selecting different age perspectives (e.g., viewing the problem through the eyes of a 40-year-old or an 80-year-old).
3.  **Perspective Shift:** The application instantly displays curated advice and wisdom relevant to that specific age group, helping the user realize that their current crisis is often just a stepping stone in a much larger journey.
